**About the Author -**
I am Kuhu Bhatnagar, aka aSagCoder. I am a Comp Sci student, currently in my third year of university. I aspire to be a game dev, creator and author someday. 

**Project Description -**
This project consists of python code (along with sample image) that uses OpenCV and Matplotlib packages and methods, like - Greyscaling and Hough Transform, etc., to detect lane lines on the given image of the road. This project belongs to the field of Computer Vision and can be a great introductory project for students and peers beginning their journey in the field of Computer Vision and A.I.
